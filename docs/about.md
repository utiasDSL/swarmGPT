SwarmGPT was created by the Learning Systems and Robotics Lab (formerly the Dynamic Systems Lab) at the Technical University of Munich and the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies. The lab is led by Prof. Angela Schoellig.

LSY works on far more than just drones and their research is centered around robots operating in increasingly unstructured, uncertain and changing environments. The lab uses ideas from controls, machine learning and optimization. Their research creates new robot control and learning algorithms that enable robotic systems to operate safely and effectively in real-world application scenarios.
